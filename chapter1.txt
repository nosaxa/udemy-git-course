In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind
ever since.
‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,
‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages that you’ve had.’
He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up


usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.
